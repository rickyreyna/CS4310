Computer Networks

Course Description:
This course covers the fundamental concepts in the design of computer networks and networking protocols with emphasis on the Internet (TCP/IP) architecture. The covered topics include: protocol layering, media access, internet routing, transport protocols and applications.

Course Objectives:
1.	Programming that uses API's and advanced data types.
2.	Programing that involves concepts of concurrency, synchronization, interprocess communication.
3.	Able to maintain preexisting code.
4.	Understand generic concepts about networks and protocols for communication.
5.	Understand the problems that 'distance' introduces into hardware and software protocols.
6.	Understand traditional information theories such as Nyquist's result, Shannon's Result, Sampling Theorem.
7.	Be able to analyze communication problems and design solutions involving standard protocols.
8.	Understand client/server concepts.
